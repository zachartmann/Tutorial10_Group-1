# Executive Summary

*// SOMEONE MAKE THIS BETTER*

This report presents the definition, analysis, and design of an improved information system solution for the call management centre (CMC) of a major travel company. The Design Thinking principles and agile methodology (Scrum) used are discussed, and iterative progress is documented on GitHub.

# Problem Definition

* The current Call Management Centre provides suboptimal:
  * Waiting times
  * RM to customer matching (mismatch)
  * Prioritisation of customers
  * Inbound call costs
* The Call Management Centre currently provides a suboptimal user experience, due to wait times and poor customer-RM matching, leading to user disatisfaction

* Adjust call flow-rate to Relationship Managers
* Improving profitability and customer satisfaction
* Match RMs and end-customers according to RMs skills and customer profiles

## **Assumptions**
 5. List assumptions you have made in the systems analysis.

*TODO*

# Conclusion *or* Explanation of each iteration intention, rationale, focus?

8. Document in GitHub all your iteration and models as you progress.

   Recording the intention, rationale, and focus of each system’s development iteration using Github’s commit messages, project boards, and issue tracking capabilities
